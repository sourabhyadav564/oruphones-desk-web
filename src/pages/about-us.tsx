					<div className="px-2">
						<h2 className="font-Roboto-Semibold text-tx"> 01. Best Prices</h2>
						<p className="font-Roboto-Light text-gx text-justify">
							The prices of used phones hike as they reach the end-user through
							multiple people. A few online shops and stores justify these
							highly inflated prices by tagging the phones as refurbished. But
							most of these phones are NOT refurbished, but devices with updates
							installed and screen-guards changed. So, many sellers and users
							are not likely to get the best deals. At ORUphones you can buy and
							sell certified used phones for free. No commission is involved, no
							fees and no hidden charges, as transactions take place directly
							between the seller and buyer. ORUphones’ AI-driven pricing engine
							curates and presents the most profitable deals to both buyers and
							sellers

							02. Safe & Secure
						</p>
						<p className="font-Roboto-Light text-gx px-2 text-justify">
							Fake or counterfeit smartphones are common in the used &
							second-hand phone markets in India. Online markets have a higher
							risk as you cannot personally check out the condition of the
							device. Phones that look brand new in pictures might be
							functioning with an outdated processor; or with cheaper components
							in place of the original parts. It takes extreme precautions and
							precise observation to spot these fake devices from real ones. We
							at ORUphones provide advanced technological tools to ensure that
							the device is branded & genuine. This eliminates any possibility
							of fraud and fake deals at ORUphones, unlike in other
							marketplaces. In addition, our Services like Data Wipe and Data
							Backup/restore helps with data privacy and minimise any risk of
							personal information and data leak.
