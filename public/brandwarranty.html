        <h2>Brand Warranty:</h2>
        <p>
            This is the Manufacturerâ€™s Warranty that is provided by the manufacturer. It is valid and can be trusted.
            You get this type of warranty when you directly purchase from the manufacturer or an authorized retailer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Customers will be given a specific time period, within which if the device malfunctions, the device will be
            repaired from brand-authorized service centres and returned to buyers. A brand new phone usually comes with
            a 12-month warranty.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Brand warranties usually cover manufacturing defects and hardware malfunctions but do not cover damage from
            unforeseen incidents.</p>
